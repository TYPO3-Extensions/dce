Additional informations
=======================

User conditions
---------------

User conditions can be used in the TypoScript setup. DCE provides such a user condition:

**user_dceOnCurrentPage**
This user condition checks if the current page contains a DCE (instance).
Usage in TypoScript:

::

	[userFunc = user_dceOnCurrentPage(42)]

The 42 is a sample for the UID of a DCE type.


Frequency asked questions (FAQ)
-------------------------------

Over the past two years, DCE has not had much documentation, I got many questions during this time, which I answered gladly.

Many questions are collected in the  :ref:`users-faq`.
