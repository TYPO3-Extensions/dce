This is the beta version of the extension "DCE".

If you found bugs or got some feature requests, write me a mail to: armin@v.ieweg.de
or report it to http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-dce

You may also get in touch via Twitter: @ArminVieweg


Quick start:
------------
To create a new DCE go to DCE backend module or to the root page (id=0) in list view (needs administrator privileges)
and create a new "DCE" record. Some actions like deleting DCEs are currently not possible in backend module, but in
list view.

Enter title and create some fields. Save and goto template tab, you'll get a list of available variables.

After saving your new content element, it is ready to use (even for content editors). If you enabled the
wizard integration you'll find the new element there, in any case it is located in the CTYPE-dropdown box if new
tt_content item.

Have fun!


Documentation:
--------------
The documentation of DCE extension is currently in progress. Extending the extension with new features und bugfixes
and writing the manual takes very much time. Thanks for your patience.
